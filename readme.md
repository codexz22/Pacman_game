# Pacman Game (Java)

A classic **Pacman game** recreated using **Java and Swing**. This interactive game features a grid-based maze, intelligent ghost movement, score tracking, and smooth controls. It demonstrates concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming**, **event-driven programming**, and **GUI development**.

## Overview
The **Pacman Game** is a desktop-based interactive project developed in **Java (Swing & AWT)**. The player controls Pacman to eat pellets while avoiding ghosts in a maze. The game includes scoring, random ghost movement, level completion, and simple animation logic.

---

## Problem Statement
The goal was to design a **fun and interactive 2D arcade game** that demonstrates key programming concepts like event handling, timers, animations, and object collision detection in Java.

---

## Dataset and Inputs
No external dataset is required.  
Inputs are user-driven through **keyboard events** (arrow keys for movement).  
Game states (walls, pellets, ghosts) are predefined in the program logic.

---

## Tools and Technologies
**Language:** Java  
**Libraries:** Swing, AWT, Java Timer  
**IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / VS Code  
**Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## Core Features
- Classic Pacman gameplay recreated in Java  
- Intelligent ghost movement and collision detection  
- Score tracking and level system  
- Smooth keyboard-based controls  
- Game over and restart functionality  
- Simple and interactive GUI  

---

## Logic and Workflow
1. The grid and maze are initialized at the start.  
2. Pacman moves based on keyboard input.  
3. Ghosts move randomly or using directional logic.  
4. Collisions with pellets increase score.  
5. Collisions with ghosts end the game.  
6. Level resets or continues based on game state.  

---

## User Interface and Design
The UI uses **Java Swing components** with a custom-rendered grid layout.  
Elements are drawn using the **Graphics** class for direct rendering.  
It features bright colors, a classic maze design, and smooth frame transitions for a nostalgic arcade feel.

---

## Strengths and Limitations
**Strengths:**  
- Lightweight and responsive gameplay  
- Demonstrates strong OOP and event-driven programming  
- Clean GUI using Java Swing  

**Limitations:**  
- Basic ghost AI (can be improved for smarter paths)  
- No sound effects or animations (optional upgrades)  

---

## Recommendations and Future Work
- Add pathfinding algorithms (like BFS/DFS) for smarter ghost AI  
- Include sound effects and background music  
- Create multiple levels with increasing difficulty  
- Add pause/resume and save game functionality  
- Port the game to JavaFX for enhanced visuals
